# Introduction

In the modern era of business, leveraging data analytics has become indispensable for organizations seeking to gain actionable insights and make informed decisions. Sales data holds immense potential for uncovering trends, understanding customer behavior, and optimizing business strategies. This graduation project endeavors to harness the power of sales data by developing a web application equipped with interactive dashboards, aimed at providing stakeholders with valuable insights into market performance.

# Objectives

This project revolves around the creation of a dynamic web application that will serve as a centralized platform for analyzing and visualizing sales data. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset capturing sales transactions, customer demographics, and product information, the web application will facilitate real-time monitoring and exploration of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to market sales.

In adition to this, making a store that contains the dashboard and have machines that decides who will take offer and how much will be this offer, and anlysis of this market.
